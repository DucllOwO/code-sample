# Checkout IPN

\*\*In this project, I built a webhook to handle order information when a user makes a successful payment, along with some simple CRUD APIs.

I implemented the Unit of Work pattern to ensure that the Atomicity in ACID is not violated. The idea is to move the commit and rollback logic, along with the try-catch block, to the highest layer, which is the router. This way, the service layer doesnâ€™t have to worry about commit or rollback logic, and services can call each other with ease.\*\*
